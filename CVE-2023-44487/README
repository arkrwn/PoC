HTTP/2 Vulnerability Checker in Go
This Go script checks the HTTP/2 support of a list of URLs, sends a RST_STREAM frame, and logs the results to a CSV file.

Usage:
Install Go: https://golang.org/doc/install
Save the script to a file named `main.go`.
Build the script: `go build -o checker main.go`
Create an input file with a list of URLs, one per line.
Run the script: `./checker -input urls.txt -output output.csv -verbose`
-input: Input file containing URLs (Required).
-output: Output CSV file (default: /dev/stdout).
-verbose: Verbose output (optional).

Note: The sendRSTStream function is not fully implemented as Go's standard library does not expose a direct way to manipulate HTTP/2 frames. This function will need a custom implementation.

This script only test to downgrade not permanently downgrade HTTP version!
