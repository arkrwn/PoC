HTTP/2 Vulnerability Checker in Go
This Go script checks the HTTP/2 support of a list of URLs, sends a RST_STREAM frame, and logs the results to a CSV file.

Usage:
Install Go: https://golang.org/doc/install
Save the script to a file named `main.go`.
Build the script: `go build -o checker main.go`
Create an input file with a list of URLs, one per line.
Run the script: `./checker -input urls.txt -output output.csv -verbose`
-input: Input file containing URLs (Required).
-output: Output CSV file (default: /dev/stdout).
-verbose: Verbose output (optional).

Note: The sendRSTStream function is not fully implemented as Go's standard library does not expose a direct way to manipulate HTTP/2 frames. This function will need a custom implementation.

This README file provides a basic usage guide, explaining how to build and run the script. The script has been structured similarly to the provided Python script, using Go's flag package for argument parsing, and the net/http and golang.org/x/net/http2 packages for HTTP/2 support checking. However, the sendRSTStream function is not fully implemented since Go's standard library does not provide a direct way to manipulate HTTP/2 frames. This function would require a custom implementation or a third-party library that provides lower-level access to HTTP/2 frames.
